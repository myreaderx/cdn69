Yet, this doesn’t mean all their projects are a resounding success. <a href="https://www.failory.com/blog/startup-failure-rate" target="_blank"><strong>Startup failure rates</strong></a> are extremely high, and while the amazing network, know-how, and access to resources of YC can help their companies, there is no such thing as a guaranteed success in Silicon Valley.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.ycdb.co/" target="_blank"><strong>YC database</strong></a>, over the last 15 years (and 30 startup batches) YC has invested in more than 2200 companies. Out of these, there are more than 400 who are officially inactive. A 20% failure rate sounds amazing for the industry, however:</p><ul role="list"><li>The majority of YC investments have happened in the last few years (over 1500 in the last 5). This means most companies in their portfolio are too young to have shut down already. If we take companies only from the first 17 YC batches, the rate of inactive companies doubles to about 40%.</li><li>These numbers don’t include all the active companies who are struggling (and unlikely) to achieve any meaningful success (an example below), and more importantly: the investments that are exited at a loss.</li></ul><p>The truth is that a significant number of startups fail even if they benefit from the best possible conditions in the world. The goal of this article isn’t to put YC down, but rather to let all of us learn from the cases where things don’t go according to plan despite all the great preconditions for success. </p><p><strong>Below you’ll find information about some of YC’s biggest failures.</strong></p><p>‍</p><h2>What is YC and why are YC startups less likely to fail?</h2><p>Y Combinator created a new model for investing in early-stage startups – they are the first-ever seed accelerator in the world. Before we start with the list of YC’s failed startups, here are the most important things you need to know about the accelerator and the value they bring to their companies:</p><p><strong>What YC does and why it’s extremely valuable for startups:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>YC runs a <strong>three-month accelerator program</strong> in which they help early-stage startups with seed <strong>funding, connections, advice, mentorship</strong>. The program finishes with a demo day, on which the startup teams present their business to outside investors (usually seed and VC investment funds).</li><li>They run the program twice a year, hence they have the <strong>summer and winter startup batches</strong>.</li><li>They usually make the <strong>first outside investment</strong> into the early-stage companies they accept into the program.</li><li>The investment amount for the accelerator program is currently <strong>$125k</strong> (down from $150k). That said, they have a “Continuity” fund that might provide further funding for their accelerator alumni.</li><li>In return for their seed investment, they take a <strong>7% share in the business.</strong></li><li>That said, the real value of YC isn’t in the seed investment. It is in the incredible <strong>network </strong>of startup entrepreneurs, tech and marketing experts, and investors that they foster. A smart founder could use this network as leverage helping them turn a good idea into a profitable business – arguably the biggest reason for YC’s lower failure rates.</li></ul><p><strong>YC’s Results:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>YC has invested in and mentored more than 2200 companies.</li><li>Some of their biggest successes are Stripe, Airbnb, DoorDash, Coinbase, Dropbox, Reddit, Docker, twitch.tv, Zapier, Heroku, etc.</li><li>The combined valuation of YC companies is over $100B.</li><li>YC has 18 unicorns (businesses worth over $1 billion) and 110 companies worth over $100 million.</li></ul><p>Due to their history and success, YC’s accelerator programs are extremely popular. Each year the number of companies that apply and are accepted increases: in 2006, only 18 companies participated in the summer and winter programs, while in 2019 YC invested in and mentored 350 startups. Their acceptance rate is around 2%, which means that the total applicants for 2019 were around 17k – approaching 10k startups per batch.</p><p><em>Getting into the YC program is a huge success on its own, so it’s very important for the accepted companies not to waste the opportunity. We did a very interesting interview with Richard Wu, the co-founder of Simmer, who participated in the 2019 YC winter batch, talking about his</em><a href="https://www.failory.com/blog/yc-mistakes" target="_blank"><strong><em> mistakes during the YC accelerator program</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p><p>‍</p><h2>Biggest Failed YC Startups based on Funding</h2><h3><strong>Atrium</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li><em>Industry: Legal Tech and Law</em></li><li><em>Funding: &gt;$75M from 100+ investors</em></li><li><em>Employees: 100-250</em></li><li><em>Founders: Augie Rakow, Bebe Chueh, Chris Smoak, Justin Kan</em></li><li><em>Closed date: Mar 4, 2020</em></li></ul><p>Atrium was an innovative law firm targeting startups and aiming to provide a better service than traditional law firms with the help of proprietary technology. It raised about $75M in funding in 5 rounds and was headed by CEO Justin Kan, the famous founder of justin.tv (later twitch.tv) with an exit to Amazon close to a billion dollars.</p><p>The Atrium vision was to create a <strong><em>full-stack vertical startup</em></strong> – to own the whole supply chain and to provide a complete A-Z legal service to clients. While this is certainly a viable goal in the long run (some of the biggest and most successful tech companies are full stack), it seems a bit foolish to try to achieve this right out of the gate. It seems like a classic case of <a href="https://startupgenome.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-the-anatomy-of-premature-scaling-new-infographic" target="_blank"><strong>premature scaling</strong></a>.</p><p><em>“Today is it not all about being more lean and agile? Being “full-stack” is surely the opposite of that.” –Brian Inkster, </em><a href="http://thetimeblawg.com/2020/03/07/atrium-a-post-mortem/#:~:text=On%20Tuesday%20(3%20March%202020,than%20a%20traditional%20law%20firm%E2%80%9D." target="_blank"><strong><em>Source TheTimeBlawg</em></strong></a></p><p>Atrium was burning through money very fast while failing to generate meaningful revenue. In an attempt to pivot, they decided to focus entirely on their technology and cut their legal division (the lawyers working for them). This move didn’t work out in the long run and when they ran out of money they were forced to close doors. Ironically, after the final shutdown of the firm, the only surviving remnant is their still-working downsized legal division. The tech stack they were focusing on failed to generate any real value and as far as we are aware wasn’t acquired by another company.<br/></p></div><div class="newsletter-pop-up"><h1 class="newsletter-pop-up-heading">✉️ Invite us into your inbox</h1><p class="paragraph-6">We&#x27;re publishing articles like this one all weeks.

The FBI raided the San Francisco offices of the company because of suspicions uBiome was billing its client’s medical insurance providers multiple times without the prior knowledge or consent of their clients. At the same time, they were pressuring doctors to approve tests.</p><p>uBiome was essentially trying to growth-hack their way to a higher revenue number without at the same time providing additional value to their clients (and at the expense of medical insurers).</p><p>Growth-hacking on the wild-west which is the internet is one thing, but when you try to use similar tactics in traditional, heavily regulated industries in developed, heavily regulated markets - that’s a recipe for disaster. The tech startup moto of “grow first, deal with the legal implications later” might not be ideal for all industries.</p><p>Judging from the fact that the company wasn’t able to secure more funding or even to find a buyer, it’s safe to assume that the technology and know-how they had was underwhelming.</p><p>The secrets of the human microbiome remain locked, for now, despite the Valley’s efforts.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Meta</h3><ul role="list"><li><em>Industry: Augmented Reality, Consumer Electronics</em></li><li><em>Funding: $73.0M from 21 investors</em></li><li><em>Founders: Ben Sand, Meron Gribetz, Raymond Lo</em></li></ul><p>Meta was making an augmented reality headset. Unlike the examples from above, a bit more happenstance is involved in their demise. The Trump administration’s trade war with China resulted in a failed funding round led by a Chinese investor, which put the company in dire straits financially. They were forced to let go of most of their workforce, and later on, the bank holding the debt of the company foreclosed the loan and sold all of Meta’s assets.</p><p>Also unlike the companies from above, a buyer was found, which means that the technology that Meta was developing was valuable even though the company wasn’t making enough money to make ends meet on its own (yet). The information about the deal is not public, but the CEO Meron Gribetz mentioned that he was encouraged by the deal: <em>“I feel like it’s a good home for the Meta assets, and that it could provide a future for them.” (</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/18/18187315/meta-vision-ar-headset-company-asset-sale-unknown-buyer-insolvent" target="_blank"><strong><em>Source</em></strong></a><em>)</em></p><p>While the tech developed by Meta could create value for its new owner and their clients, it’s extremely unlikely that YC and consequent investors in the company managed to recoup their losses.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Call9</h3><ul role="list"><li><em>Industry: Healthcare, Health Tech, Telemedicine</em></li><li><em>Funding: $34M from 10 investors</em></li><li><em>Employees: 100</em></li><li><em>Founders Celina Tenev, Timothy Peck, XiaoSong Mu</em></li></ul><p>The premise of Call9 was to enable patients in nursing homes to receive remote emergency medical consultations, hopefully avoiding the stressful wait for an ambulance and in an emergency room.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.failory.com/cemetery/call9" target="_blank"><strong>reason for Call9’s failure</strong></a> is complex, but it boils down to trouble with the adoption of the “value-based care” business model – paying for the value provided, rather than the time of the specialist. The company was burning significantly more money than what it was making and eventually had to lay off its 100 employees. They tried to make partnerships with medical insurance providers on the basis of saving them money by preventing unnecessary trips to the emergency room, but even though this seems very reasonable, they didn’t manage to move the needle enough to keep the doors open.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Boosted</h3><ul role="list"><li><em>Industry: Micromobility (electric longboards and scooters)</em></li><li><em>Funding: $73.0M from 16 investors </em></li><li><em>Founders: John Ulmen, Matthew Tran, Sanjay Dastoor</em></li></ul><p>Failure for the investors (YC included) doesn’t necessarily mean a full shutdown of the business.</p><p>Hardware businesses are capital intensive and usually operate on low margins, which means that any disturbance in the supply chain can cause a great deal of trouble. Boosted, who practically established the electric longboard niche with its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/170315130/boosted-boards-the-worlds-lightest-electric-vehicl" target="_blank"><strong>successful Kickstarter campaign</strong></a>, was forced to lay off most of its employees when the Trump administration started the tariff wars with China.</p><p>The situation is dire not only for Boosted, however. Fellow YC-backed electric scooter startup <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/business/unicorn-e-scooter-startup-fails-refunds-uncertain/2192561/#:~:text=Nick%20Evans%2C%20founder%20and%20CEO,were%20going%20up%20and%20up.%22" target="_blank"><strong>Unicorn Rides (part of the very recent Winter 2019 YC batch) went belly up</strong></a> because of economic reasons. Competitor electric longboard manufacturers Inboard also shut down recently. And the e-bike startup Wheels was forced to let employees go despite raising $100 million in funding.</p><p>This is quite a clear illustration that even Y Combinator, with all of their muscle and know-how, cannot bend market forces at will. Even their big investments who have impressively managed to validate an innovative product are subject to political and market risks.</p><p>Even if Boosted manages to survive due to downsizing and hopefully improving market conditions, they are unlikely to miraculously start growing and claiming considerable market share. Their first-mover advantage is not particularly valuable if competitors outside of the US start producing a good-enough, cheaper product. All of this means that the $70 million investment in the company is in significant trouble even if the company doesn’t close doors.</p><p>Startup investors make their money from big exit events fueled by rapid growth (and, frankly, a monopolistic position in the market). Getting $70 million back from dividend payments of a downsized company is not viable. So, the more likely outcome is that investors will try to recoup some losses by selling their shares (or the whole company) at a large discount to another business interested in the niche.<br/></p></div><div class="block-ad-div"><h3 class="black-text"><strong>Your one-stop shop for everything dev-related.</strong><br/></h3><p class="black-text">Anything you need, our devs can build: complex e-commerce solutions, custom software or SaaS, beautiful WordPress websites… anything.

Although they are usually much smaller and didn’t attract media attention, they might be more representative of the more common reasons YC startups (and startups in general) fail.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Memamp</h3><ul role="list"><li>Industry: Search</li><li>Funding: Seed round by YC</li><li>Founder: Chris Slowe</li></ul><p>Memamp was one of the first companies ever funded by YC, and they were trying to develop a better search solution for desktop. The reason the company closed, however, is pretty simple: both Google and Apple announced they would develop their own desktop search solution (Spotlight and Desktop Search). All of a sudden there was no market need for what Memamp was developing, and the company was dead before YC’s summer founders program was even complete.</p><p>‍</p><h3>The Buttermilk Company</h3><ul role="list"><li><em>Industry: E-Commerce, Food and Beverage, Food Delivery</em></li><li> <em>Funding: $120K from YC</em></li><li><em>Founders: Mitra Raman</em></li></ul><p>Buttermilk participated in the Summer of 2018 startup batch and is one of the many early-stage startups that don’t manage to grow the business successfully. The reasons for the failure are presented in a bit more details by the founder in <strong></strong><a href="https://medium.com/@ramannoodlez/goodbye-buttermilk-ca570be4b56b" target="_blank"><strong>his Medium post</strong></a>, but the gist of it is pretty common for the startup industry:</p><ul role="list"><li> <strong>Burnout: </strong>running a startup is extremely taxing, and doing it as a solo founder - even more so. Burnout followed by depression and other mental health problems isn’t uncommon.</li><li><strong>Unit Economics: </strong>scaling a consumer product goods company is much more difficult than scaling a digital product/service because of the marginal costs of production. This is even more difficult in the food and beverage market which is extremely competitive and customers expect a low price even for high-quality goods. This means that scaling a successful MVP experiment to a real business is a big problem for startups in the niche.</li><li><strong>Retail or bust: </strong>distributing a product online and distributing it through a retail network are two very distinct problems. Customers often expect to be able to find food products in retail networks, which is another growth hurdle for such startups.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Mylk Guys</h3><ul role="list"><li><em>Industry: E-Commerce, Food and Beverage, Food Delivery</em></li><li><em>Funding: Undisclosed amount from YC and 4 other seed-round investors</em></li><li><em>Founders: Gaurav Maken</em></li></ul><p>Mylk Guys aspired to become the Amazon for vegan products. The officially stated reason for their failure was that the very thin margins in the food and beverage market didn’t mesh well with the high logistics costs of shipping throughout the US. The company is unlikely to be financially successful unless it reaches amazing economies of scale. If it isn’t growing fast enough to suggest it will reach sufficient size in reasonable time, it’s not a surprise the business closed down.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Magic Instruments</h3><ul role="list"><li><em>Industry: Consumer Electronics, Music, Mobile Apps</em></li><li><em>Funding: $2M, +</em><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mi-guitar-by-magic-instruments#/" target="_blank"><strong><em> Crowdfunding campaign</em></strong></a></li><li><em>Founders: Andrew Song, Brian Fan, Mark Liebman</em></li></ul><p>Magic Instruments was developing a redesign of the guitar which replaces strings with the goal of making the instrument more easily accessible. Despite<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11459076/magic-instruments-rhythm-guitar-announced-indiegogo" target="_blank"><strong> doubts about product-market</strong></a> fit, the company ran a relatively successful IndieGoGo campaign and was seeing demand for their product. Nonetheless, after pre-purchasing, their customers <a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/san-francisco/profile/music-instrument-store/magic-instruments-1116-879379/complaints" target="_blank"><strong>didn’t receive the product for years</strong></a> and eventually stopped receiving communication by Magic Instruments.</p><p>The exact reason for MI’s failure to deliver is unknown, but it’s not an uncommon situation for crowdfunded hardware products. Developing a proof of concept prototype is one thing, manufacturing in scale is a totally different beast and many inexperienced startups fail to tackle this issue because of one reason or another.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Plurchase</h3><ul role="list"><li><em>Industry: E-Commerce, Social Media</em></li><li><em>Funding: seed by YC</em></li></ul><p>Plurchase tried to turn online shopping into a social experience by integrating social features into existing online stores.</p><p>On the surface level, this seems like a very reasonable goal. A social layer would add value to online shopping, and other industries have been successful at adding such a social layer to their online experience. For example, live chat, donations, friend lists, and other social features have enabled twitch.tv to make watching someone else play a video game from your home an easily shareable experience - with your friends or other members of the video games community.</p><p>Nonetheless, every attempt to tackle the same problem for e-commerce has been unsuccessful, and Plurchase is definitely not the only startup that has tried to make e-commerce social from one angle or another.</p><p>Even though this seems like a logical problem to solve, it might just be the case that it is a problem not enough people have.<br/></p></div><h4 class="cta-subscribe-blog">✉️ Subscribe to our newsletter!</h4><p class="paragraph-subscribe-blog">Invite us into your inbox and get immense learning and <strong class="white-text">80+ deals on tools</strong> to help you scale your startup (<strong class="white-text">worth up to $50,000</strong>)!<br/></p><div class="div-block-sendinblue-form-content"><div class="w-embed w-script"><!-- Begin Sendinblue Form -->
